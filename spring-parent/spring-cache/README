Gerard Ribas: Spring Cache
=================

This is the readme file for spring-cache project.

In this project you can see the new feature included in Spring since version 3.1. With this example you can see how it's easy to adding caching into an existing application. 

It's easy to use, only we need to put @Cacheable in the method that we want to cache. For removing cache we need to put @CacheEvict and cache it's deleted.

This simple example only uses a simple JDK Cache implementation. (JDK ConcurrentMap-based)

What is in this package
=======================

	--src
		--es.gerardribas.example.spring.cache
	--test
		--es.gerardribas.example.spring.cache

This run's? Let's try it!
=========================

Remember! You need previously installed this dependency: 
	<dependency>
		<groupId>es.gerardribas</groupId>
		<artifactId>persistence</artifactId>
		<version>SOME VERSION...</version>
	</dependency>

For test this new feature I created a very very simple test case that you can see how it's easy to fill the cache and how it's easy to deleting.
